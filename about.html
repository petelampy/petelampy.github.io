            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Peter Lampard and this is my photography/portfolio/general stuff website. I am a university student currently studying BSc Software Engineering at Nottingham Trent University. I spend my free time programming, practicing drone photography and gaming, and this website will showcase some of my work.</p>
            <p>The majority of my work has just been for myself, but I have worked with several clients previously (who are listed at the bottom of this page). I hope to work with more people in the future and gain a wider range of photography experience.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy browsing my gallery of work, if you need to contact me I am available at: peter@lampard.dev</p>
            <p>- P. Lampard</p>
